### "Serial COM" v3.0.0 (Beta) PREVIOUS RELEASES NOTES

- The "Serial COM" 3.0.0 Plugin now works nativelley in Unreal Engine 4.27/4.26/4.24 (PARTIAL SUPPORT WITH UE 5EA*) without having to re-build the project and possibly not be able to re-build for the lack of missing SDK's requirements. 
* Unreal Engine 5(Early Access) still requires to rebuild the plugin. UE5 is able to rebuild the plugin. Until a new method to rebuild the plugin for UE5 is available, this is the only version compatible with UE5.

- The new plugin will appear in your plugin list as "Communication Serial Port (Serial COM)". On your blueprints, is going to be listed in the "Communication Serial" category list instead of "UE4Duino". Search for "Arduino, Serial, Communication" will also show the results for these functions. 

- Added Flow Control from the last UE4Duino 2.2.5's Pull request from "SG1EmberWolf"(https://github.com/SG1EmberWolf) 
	- Added "Open Serial Port with Flow Control"
	- Added "Open Serial Port with Target and Flow Control"
  
  - The new module name changed from "UE4Duino" to "SERIALCOM". That also means that both plugins (potentially) can live together inside a blueprint without causing conflicts, but is not recommended.

- Internally, changed naming of "Serial.h" files includes name. This "Serial.h" is very popular in many libraries. To avoid possible future corruption and confusion, it was renamed to "SerialCom.h".

- The BETA version will continue to stay in BETA mode until no serious problems get reported and the final version will be 100% compatible with this release.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Issues:
----------------------------

- "Serial COM" will not be compatible with "UE4Duino" 2.2.5 because the library doesn't share the "UE4DUINO" name anymore, using its own new "SERIALCOM" identifier. Changing to this library will make the old EU4Duino modules in red, indicating that those components are not available anymore.
Solution: Each component can be replaced with the current version by replacing each one by hand. The replacement equivalent chart is available at:
https://github.com/videofeedback/Unreal-Engine-Plugin-Communication-Serial-Port  (Modules lists comparison chart)

- Arduino doesn't connects again if you close the project without closing the port.
Solution:  Use the best practice of creating an "Event End Play" with "Close Serial Port" connected to the event. This is the cleanest solution for this problem and best practice.

## Blueprint Example

Each Zip file contains the correstpondent blueprint for each UE version. Drag and drop the .uasset (Blueprint) file to your project. Read the complete insturctions inside the "BLUEPRINT" folder of this plugin.
